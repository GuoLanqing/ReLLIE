# ReLLIE: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Customized Low-Light Image Enhancement

This repository contains the official implementation of the ACMMM 2021 paper [ReLLIE: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Customized Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05830).

## Introduction
To tackle the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) problem, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning based method, dubbed ReLLIE, for customized low-light enhancement. Specifically,
ReLLIE models LLIE as a markov decision process, i.e., estimating the pixel-wise image-specific curves sequentially and recurrently. Given the reward computed from a set of carefully crafted non-reference loss functions, a lightweight 
network is proposed to estimate the curves for enlightening of a low-light image input. For more details, please refer to our [orginal paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05830).

## Requirement
* Python 3.5+
* Chainer 5.0+
* Cupy 5.0+
* OpenCV 3.4+
* Torch 1.6

You can install the required libraries by the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. We checked this code on cuda-10.0 and cudnn-7.3.1.


## Usage
### Training
If you want to train the model
1. `git clone git@github.com:GuoLanqing/ReLLIE.git`
2. download the training data [LOL dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/157bjO1_cFuSd0HWDUuAmcHRJDVyWpOxB/view) or your own dataset
3. unzip and put the downloaded "ours485" and "eval15" folders to root folder
```
python train.py
```

### Testing with pretrained models
If you want to test the pretrained model on noisy low-light images (enhancement with denoising)
```
python test.py
```
or on high-quality low-light images (enhancement without denoising)
```
python test_el.py
```

## References
We used the publicly avaliable pretrained models of [FFDNet](https://github.com/cszn/FFDNet) as the denoiser module.
